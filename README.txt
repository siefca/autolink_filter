This module adds a filter to automatically link known taxonomy terms.

TODO:

add setting 'minimum word length' (0 - 32) i 'maximum word length' (0 - 1024 - any)
defaults: 2, 32

add setting for content type selection (?)

Why the term fetching is it called 3 times? Fix it using some static method that will keep the vocab.
