Adds a filter to automatically link known taxonomy terms.

== Features ==

 * words exclusion and HTML tags based exclusion
 * manual inclusion when special boolean field is added to taxonomy terms

TODO:

- test if main term is too long but its synonyms are ok.
- test for parent tags and parent classes exclusion
- also test if tooltips are generated

- add setting for content type or content type / content field selection (e.g. 'articles only'),
- add class exclusion support (e.g. elements that are enclosed with some class are not highlighted),
- add an option to use tooltips field OR description,
- add JS for tooltips,
- change DOM parser to faster.
